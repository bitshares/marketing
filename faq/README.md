# Is there a brief summary of the BitShares blockchain?

The BitShares Blockchain is an industrial-grade decentralized platform built for high-performance financial smart contracts 
mostly known for: its token factory, a decentralized exchange as a built-in native dapp (known as the DEX) and its stablecoins 
or, as they are called in BitShares, Smartcoins. It represents the first decentralized autonomous community that 
lets its core token holders decide on its future direction and products by means of on-chain voting. It is also the first 
DPoS blockchain in existence and the first blockchain to implement stablecoins. 

The BitShares Blockchain has a reserve fund that is used for paying block producers and funding development. 
The fund is refilled by collecting transaction fees from anyone that operates on the blockchain and it can be accessed in a 
trustless way via worker proposals, that are being voted on by all BTS holders. 

In general the BitShares Blockchain is an industrial-scale blockchain that can sustain over 17,000 operations per second 
(theoretical limits  > 100,000 tps) and enables various business models. This includes among others the support for 
sophisticated payment solutions (e.g. using direct debit authorization), tokenization and digitization of 
real world assets, storing documents or legal contracts tamper-proof on the blockchain, holding company shares directly on 
the blockchain with KYC and a legal framework that guarantees that the token actually represents the respective shares, 
as well as many other use cases that involve any kind of token management.
